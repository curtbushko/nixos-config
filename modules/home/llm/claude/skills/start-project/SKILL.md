# Project Startup Checklist

CRITICAL: Before writing ANY code, ALWAYS complete this checklist:

1. List available skills: ls ~/.claude/skills/
2. Read ALL relevant skill files for the language/framework
3. Confirm you understand the requirements:
    - Testing approach (TDD? Coverage?)
    - Code patterns (interfaces, dependency injection?)
    - Quality gates (build/lint/test must pass?)
4. If ANY skills exist for the language, explicitly state:
    "I will follow the [language] skill guidelines including [key requirements]"
5. Ask user for any project-specific requirements

NEVER start implementation without completing this checklist.

If you skip this checklist, you are violating your core responsibilities.
